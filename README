Proiect - Etapa 2 - Santa Claus is coming to ACS students

# Design Patterns used:
- Singleton Pattern for the database
- Strategy Pattern for the average nice score calculation and for the gift
giving strategies
- Factory Pattern for creating NiceScoreStrategy objects
- Builder Pattern for applying the bonus to averageNiceScore of each child

# About updates of the flow of the program in Etapa2
Data input is adapted to read the new data that the program needs.

After the average nice score is calculated, the bonus is applied using
the builder pattern.

After each child's budget is calculated, the bonuses for the Pink and Black
elves are applied in the BudgetCalculator class.

The gift giving functionality is expanded, now each year has a certain strategy
used to give gifts. Each strategy is assigned a class that extends the abstract
class GiftGivingStrategy which contains the method giveGifts used by the
GiftGiver to assign gifts to all children and an auxiliary function
giveGiftsToChildren that assigns gifts to the children in the given ArrayList
in order.

For the NiceScoreCityStrategy, a list is created containing a city-score pair
containing the cities that have at least one child living in them and the
average score of those children. This list is used to determine which city
is visited first.

After the strategy has assigned gifts to children, the yellow elf is applied to
the children that were assigned it.
